# Deep Learning Sign Language Interpreter

Welcome to the Sign Language Interpreter powered by Deep Learning! This project utilizes cutting-edge technology to interpret sign language gestures using a neural network.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Anaconda or Any Navigator**: Install to manage packages effortlessly.
- **Python Packages**:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - OpenCV (cv2)
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

### Quick Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Konathalavenkat/Sign-Language-interpreter.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use Anaconda or your preferred package manager to install the required packages.
3. **Create Your Dataset**: Run `Custom_dataset.py` to generate your dataset. Don't forget to adjust the file path.
4. **Build the Model**: Execute `model.py`, providing the path to the newly created dataset.
5. **Test the Model**: Run `recognize.py` to see the magic happen!

## How It Works

This Sign Language Interpreter employs state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. It recognizes and translates sign language gestures into text or spoken language using a trained neural network model.

### Customization

Feel free to expand the dataset with more sign language gestures for enhanced accuracy and inclusivity. Train the model with diverse data to improve recognition capabilities.
